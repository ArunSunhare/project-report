        <h1>Urban Food Waste Management in India - Problem and Solution</h1>
        
        <section>
            <h2>Problem Statement: Urban Food Waste and Its Impact in India</h2>
            <p>Urban food waste is a significant issue in cities across India. Each year, approximately 67 million tons of food is wasted in India, with urban areas being major contributors. This waste occurs at various stages, from food production and distribution to consumer waste. Inefficient waste management systems and consumer behavior exacerbate the problem in cities.</p>
            <h3>Impact:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Decomposing food waste in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas contributing to climate change.</li>
                        <li>Resource Depletion: The water, energy, and labor used to produce wasted food are lost.</li>
                        <li>Landfill Overuse: Increased food waste contributes to the rapid filling of landfills.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Financial Loss: The economic value of wasted food is substantial, with an estimated annual loss of $14 billion.</li>
                        <li>Waste Management Costs: High costs in managing and disposing of food waste.</li>
                        <li>Opportunity Cost: Wasted food could be redirected to feed people, addressing food insecurity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Social Impact:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Food Insecurity: Despite the abundance of wasted food, many urban residents face food insecurity. Effective food waste management can alleviate this issue.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Preliminary Research:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates food waste accounts for about 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                <li>Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) indicates that about 40% of food production in India is lost during distribution.</li>
                <li>Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data shows that about 50% of urban solid waste in India is organic waste, with food waste being a major component.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why It Needs to Be Solved:</h3>
            <p>Addressing urban food waste is critical for environmental sustainability, economic efficiency, and social equity. Reducing food waste can mitigate climate change, save resources, reduce economic losses, and help combat food insecurity.</p>

            <h2>Solution: Smart Urban Food Waste Management System</h2>
            <h3>Methodology:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data-Driven Waste Tracking:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use IoT sensors in waste bins to track the amount and type of food waste generated.</li>
                        <li>Develop a mobile app for users to monitor their food waste patterns and receive feedback on how to reduce waste.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Waste Reduction Incentives:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implement a reward system for households and businesses that reduce their food waste.</li>
                        <li>Partner with local businesses to offer incentives for customers who bring their own containers or purchase imperfect produce.</li>
                    </ul>
